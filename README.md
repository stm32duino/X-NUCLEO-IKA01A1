# X-NUCLEO-IKA01A1

Multifunctional expansion board based on operational amplifiers.
The X-NUCLEO-IKA01A1 is a multifunctional expansion board based on STMicroelectronics operational amplifiers.
It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for various use cases with your STM32 Nucleo board. 
The X-NUCLEO-IKA01A1 is compatible with the Arduinoâ„¢ UNO R3 connector, and supports the addition of other boards 
that can be stacked for enhanced applications with an STM32 Nucleo board. It can be used as an analog front-end 
by conditioning signals as actuator to drive LEDs or coils, or in a comparator architecture.
Thanks to its current-sensing configuration, it allows current measurement of any device that has a Micro-USB port. 
A highly accurate TSZ124 Micropower operational amplifier is used for this configuration as well as for that of 
the instrumentation amplifier. The expansion board also contains a TSU104 Nanopower op-amp and a TSV734 Micropower 
op-amp for mobile applications.

Key Features:
* 7 predefined configurations:
* Instrumentation amplifier structure
* Current sensing with or without USB
* Photodiode/ultraviolet (UV) current sensing
* Buffer
* Full wave rectifier
* Constant current LED driver
* Window comparator
* One prototyping area
* Compatible with STM32 Nucleo boards
* Comprehensive free development firmware library (X-CUBE-ANALOG1)
* Powered through the Arduino UNO connectors
* RoHS compliant
